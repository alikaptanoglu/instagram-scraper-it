## What you need to run Instagram-scrap-it:
    - get your session id on your Instagram & logout
    - Instagram-scrap-it will ask you to enter the session ID for work :)

## About Session ID activity:
- it will stay for more than 5 days for active use, 
      after some days session id will be re-generated by Instagram.
      so, you need to get a new session id


## Highlight about Instagram-scrap-it:
- no need to use sign-in details
- user-friendly
- load faster
- no API authentication
- builtin live status for Instagram-scrap-it

## COMMON - you need to be aware of Instagram [my opinion]
     - if your main profile URL gets blocked, just leave it for 24 or 48 hours
     - suppose you make 20 requests, just give some hours gaps
     - inbox, main page - don't get blocked 
     - don't ever give plenty of requests like 100, Instagram thinks you like a spam bot
     - they collect a device id and Infos to figure out what we're doing all the time
     - Instagram is tricky API - give false information too -  ex: users: [], status: 'ok'
